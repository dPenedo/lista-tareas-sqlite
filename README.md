# PyTask - A Task Manager with SQLite

## Overview

This project demonstrates a clean, and easy-to-use task management system built with **Python** and **SQLite** with tests on **pytest**. It focuses on applying key software development principles such as clean code, functional programming, and practical database interactions. It's made to explore **SQLite** operations in **Python** and build console applications with minimal dependencies.

## Key Features

- **Task Creation:** Add tasks with specific deadlines.
- **View Tasks:** Quickly view tasks, including completed ones.
- **Mark Task as Complete:** Efficiently mark tasks as completed to keep track of your progress.
- **Edit Task:** Edit task details, whether it's the entire task or a single attribute.
- **Delete Task:** Delete tasks with confirmation to prevent accidental removals.
- **Minimal Dependencies:** Uses built-in libraries (sqlite3, datetime), making it lightweight and easy to set up.

### How to Use it

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/dPenedo/lista-tareas-sqlite
cd lista-tareas-sqlite
```
2.  Run the script:

```bash
Copiar c√≥digo
python main.py
```
This will open a command-line interface where you can interact with the task manager.

Follow the on-screen instructions to create, view, edit, or delete tasks.

### Purpose of the proyect
- **Practice SQLite**: Master SQL queries within Python and understand database interactions at a practical level.
- **Python**: Improve Python skills with useful applications, focusing on user input, error handling, and database operations.
- **Pytest**: Multiple features include integrated unit tests to ensure the application runs smoothly.

### Skills Showcased
- **Python** programming
- **SQLite** and database management
- Console application development
- Test-driven development (TDD) with **pytest**
- **Clean code** and **error handling** best practices
